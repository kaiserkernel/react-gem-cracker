As a rule, a community site that becomes popular will decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that this is not inevitable—that by making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can keep it from happening.</p><p>Essentially there are two rules here: don&#x27;t post or upvote crap links, and don&#x27;t be rude or dumb in comment threads.</p><p>A crap link is one that&#x27;s only superficially interesting. Stories on HN don&#x27;t have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren&#x27;t only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.</p><p>What does &quot;deeply interesting&quot; mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world. A story about a robbery, for example, would probably not be deeply interesting. But if this robbery was a sign of some bigger, underlying trend, perhaps it could be.</p><p>The worst thing to post or upvote is something that&#x27;s intensely but shallowly interesting: gossip about famous people, funny or cute pictures or videos, partisan political articles, etc. If you let<!-- --> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_perch">that sort of thing onto a news site, it will push aside the deeply interesting stuff, which tends to be quieter.</a></p><p>The most important principle on HN, though, is to make thoughtful comments. Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial.</p><p>The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your comment teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing out some consideration that hadn&#x27;t previously been mentioned, and by giving more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience. Whereas comments like &quot;LOL!&quot; or worse still, &quot;That&#x27;s retarded!&quot; teach us nothing.</p><p>Empty comments can be ok if they&#x27;re positive. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with submitting a comment saying just &quot;Thanks.&quot; What we especially discourage are comments that are empty and negative—comments that are mere name-calling.</p><p>Which brings us to the most important principle on HN: civility. Since long before the web, the anonymity of online conversation has lured people into being much ruder than they&#x27;d be in person. So the principle here is: don&#x27;t say anything you wouldn&#x27;t say face to face. This doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t disagree. But disagree without calling names. If you&#x27;re right, your argument will be more convincing without them.<br/><br/><br/><table style="padding:0px;background-color:#ff6600;width:100%"><tbody><tr style="height:0px"><td style="padding:0px"></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><span class="foot"><br/><br/></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/newswelcome","query":{},"buildId":"ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-46552457ef8ae77d40aa.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/newswelcome" src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/pages/newswelcome.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-b65cab0b00afd201cbda.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.f606ec8f3a6caf8e9ba1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/918e41368aa251628168fbc88b2559636c281e8c.d32b2e4875c0b1cb7cd9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-66c0425fb3e8acc95c1f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/18c9d636b9f1bbda3e4ddb3887742558413f57e4.3fd1c396a0a6f8eb5b88.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
