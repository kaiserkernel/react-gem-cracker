Comments in comment threads are ranked the same way.</p><p>Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which downweights overheated discussions, and moderator intervention.</p><p><b>How is a user&#x27;s karma calculated?</b></p><p>Roughly, the number of upvotes on their stories and comments minus the number of downvotes. The numbers don&#x27;t match up exactly, because some votes aren&#x27;t counted to prevent abuse.</p><p><b>Why don&#x27;t I see down arrows?</b></p><p>There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies.</p><p><b>What kind of formatting can you use in comments?</b></p><p><a href="/formatdoc">http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc</a></p><p><b>How do I submit a question?</b></p><p>Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank.</p><p><b>How do I make a link in a question?</b></p><p>You can&#x27;t. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with their comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to submit a link with comments, just submit it, then add a regular comment.</p><p><b id="cflag">How do I flag a comment?</b></p><p>Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click the &#x27;flag&#x27; link at the top. There&#x27;s a small karma threshold before flag links appear.</p><p><b>Are reposts ok?</b></p><p>If a story has had significant attention in the last year or so, we kill reposts as duplicates. If not, a small number of reposts is ok.</p><p>Please don&#x27;t delete and repost the same story, though. Accounts that do that eventually lose submission privileges.</p><p><b>Are paywalls ok?</b></p><p>It&#x27;s ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have workarounds.</p><p>In comments, it&#x27;s ok to ask how to read an article and to help other users do so. But please don&#x27;t post complaints about paywalls. Those are off topic.</p><p></p><p><b>Can I ask people to upvote my submission?</b></p><p>No. Users should vote for a story because it&#x27;s intellectually interesting, not because someone is promoting it.</p><p>When the software detects a voting ring, it penalizes the post. Accounts that vote like this eventually get their votes ignored.</p><p><b>Can I post a job ad?</b></p><p>Please do not post job ads as story submissions to HN.</p><p>A regular &quot;Who Is Hiring?&quot; thread appears on the first weekday of each month. Most job ads are welcome there. (But only an account called<!-- --> <a href="/submitted?id=whoishiring">whoishiring</a> <!-- -->is allowed to submit the thread itself. This prevents a race to post it first.)</p><p>The other kind of job ad is reserved for YC-funded startups. These appear on the front page, but are not stories: they have no vote arrows, points, or comments. They begin part-way down, then fall steadily, and only one should be on the front page at a time.</p><p><b>Why can&#x27;t I post a comment to a thread?</b></p><p>Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks, or if the submission has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.</p><p><b>In my profile, what does showdead do?</b></p><p>If you turn it on, you&#x27;ll see all the stories and comments that have been killed by HN&#x27;s software, moderators, and user flags.</p><p><b>In my profile, what is delay?</b></p><p>It gives you time to edit your comments before they appear to others. Set it to the number of minutes you&#x27;d like. The maximum is 10.</p><p><b>In my profile, what is noprocrast?</b></p><p>It&#x27;s a way to help you prevent yourself from spending too much time on HN. If you turn it on you&#x27;ll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. You can override noprocrast if you want, in which case your visit clock starts over at zero.</p><p><b>How do I submit a poll?</b></p><p><a href="/newpoll">http://news.ycombinator.com/newpoll</a></p><p><b>How do I reset my password?</b></p><p>If you have an email address in your profile, you can request a password reset<!-- --> <a href="/forgot?id=">here</a>. If you haven&#x27;t, you can create a new account or email hn@ycombinator.com for help.</p><p><b>My IP address seems to be banned. How can I unban it?</b></p><p>If you request many pages too quickly, your IP address might get banned. The<!-- --> <a href="/item?id=4761102">self-serve unbanning procedure</a> <!-- -->works most of the time.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><table style="padding:0px;background-color:#ff6600;width:100%"><tbody><tr style="height:0px"><td style="padding:0px"></td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><span class="foot"><br/><br/></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/newsfaq","query":{},"buildId":"ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-46552457ef8ae77d40aa.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/newsfaq" src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/pages/newsfaq.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-b65cab0b00afd201cbda.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.f606ec8f3a6caf8e9ba1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/918e41368aa251628168fbc88b2559636c281e8c.d32b2e4875c0b1cb7cd9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-66c0425fb3e8acc95c1f.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/18c9d636b9f1bbda3e4ddb3887742558413f57e4.3fd1c396a0a6f8eb5b88.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ZCr3MtHe-5fRWVnqq7gGI/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
